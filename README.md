Take-Home Challenge

This is your time to show-off your hacking / coding skills! Here is a quick coding exercise to do completely on your own. Use your favorite editor, feel free to Google anything you want and hack-away!

This challenge will also give you a teaser on the type of projects you will be working on in the store-services team.

Challange

Please see this list (sampleItems.txt) of item ids. Each id, represents a product in Walmart's catalogue. You are to write a REST search API that takes in a keyword and returns the list of products that have descriptions containing the keyword. A sample keyword would be backpack and that should return 3 products, i.e. 35613901, 35813552, 23117408.

To get the metadata associated with each product, please use Walmart's Product API with the API key kjybrqfdgp3u4yv2qzcnjndj.

Below is a sample request

http://api.walmartlabs.com/v1/items/14225185?format=json&apiKey=kjybrqfdgp3u4yv2qzcnjndj
Please keep in mind that the API rate-limits requests. So, as opposed to making requests in parallel, prefer serial requests.

Duration

Coding the challenge should take roughly 90 mins. Once 90 mins is elapsed (or if you hacked it all up before 90 mins) please send us a link to your repo. We don't want you to go crazy and spend more time than what we are asking for.

If you have any questions at any point, feel free to ping us via IM.

Format

Please create a repo for your project. Please keep it tidy as we will go over your code-base. The final submission is a link to this repo (you can make it public).
